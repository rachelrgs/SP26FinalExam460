## Part 1: Problem Analysis

> Document why this problem is not just a shortest-path problem. Three bullet points, one
> per question. Each bullet should be 1-2 sentences max.

- **Why a single shortest-path run from S is not enough:**
  _Running Dijkstra once from S can find the cheapest path to each location on its own, but it
can’t figure out the best order to visit multiple relic chambers. For example, going to R1 before
R2 might cost less overall than going to R2 before R1, and a single run doesn’t compare those 
possibilities._

- **What decision remains after all inter-location costs are known:**
  _Even after we know the cheapest travel cost between every important location, we still have
to decide the best order to collect the relics before finally heading to the exit._

- **Why this requires a search over orders (one sentence):**
  _Since the total fuel cost changes depending on the order the relics are visited, the engine has 
to check different possible orders to find the cheapest overall route._

## Part 2: Precomputation Design

### Part 2a: Source Selection

> List the source node types as a bullet list. For each, one-line reason.

| Source Node Type | Why it is a source |
|---|---|
| _Spawn (entrance) S_ | _The Torchbearer departs from here, so we need the cheapest cost from S to every relic and to the exit._ |
| _Each relic chamber Ri_ | _After picking up a relic, the Torchbearer travels from that relic to another relic or to the exit, so we need distances from every relic too._ |

### Part 2b: Distance Storage

> Fill in the table. No prose required.

| Property | Your answer                                                                                                     |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data structure name | Nested dictionary (dict[node, dict[node, float]])                                                               |
| What the keys represent | A source node (spawn or a relic) that Dijkstra was run from                                                     |
| What the values represent | A dictionary mapping every graph node to its minimum travel cost from that source                               |
| Lookup time complexity | O(1) average                                                                                                    |
| Why O(1) lookup is possible | Python dictionaries use hash tables, so values can usually be found instantly using their key without searching |

### Part 2c: Precomputation Complexity

> State the total complexity and show the arithmetic. Two to three lines max.

- **Number of Dijkstra runs:** _k + 1 (one per relic, plus one from spawn)_
- **Cost per run:** _O(m log n), where m = |E| and n = |V|_
- **Total complexity:** _O((k + 1) · m log n)_
- **Justification (one line):** _We run Dijkstra once for every k + 1 source node. Each run processes the whole graph and uses heap operations that take O(log n) time._

## Part 3: Algorithm Correctness

> Document your understanding of why Dijkstra produces correct distances.
> Bullet points and short sentences throughout. No paragraphs.

### Part 3a: What the Invariant Means

> Two bullets: one for finalized nodes, one for non-finalized nodes.
> Do not copy the invariant text from the spec.

- **For nodes already finalized (in S):**
  _Your answer here._

- **For nodes not yet finalized (not in S):**
  _Your answer here._

### Part 3b: Why Each Phase Holds

> One to two bullets per phase. Maintenance must mention nonnegative edge weights.

- **Initialization : why the invariant holds before iteration 1:**
  _Your answer here._

- **Maintenance : why finalizing the min-dist node is always correct:**
  _Your answer here._

- **Termination : what the invariant guarantees when the algorithm ends:**
  _Your answer here._

### Part 3c: Why This Matters for the Route Planner

> One sentence connecting correct distances to correct routing decisions.

_Your answer here._

## Part 4: Search Design

### Why Greedy Fails

> State the failure mode. Then give a concrete counter-example using specific node names
> or costs (you may use the illustration example from the spec). Three to five bullets.

- **The failure mode:** _Your answer here._
- **Counter-example setup:** _Your answer here._
- **What greedy picks:** _Your answer here._
- **What optimal picks:** _Your answer here._
- **Why greedy loses:** _Your answer here._

### What the Algorithm Must Explore

> One bullet. Must use the word "order."

- _Your answer here._

## Part 5: State and Search Space

### Part 5a: State Representation

> Document the three components of your search state as a table.
> Variable names here must match exactly what you use in torchbearer.py.

| Component | Variable name in code | Data type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current location | | | |
| Relics already collected | | | |
| Fuel cost so far | | | |

### Part 5b: Data Structure for Visited Relics

> Fill in the table.

| Property | Your answer |
|---|---|
| Data structure chosen | |
| Operation: check if relic already collected | Time complexity: |
| Operation: mark a relic as collected | Time complexity: |
| Operation: unmark a relic (backtrack) | Time complexity: |
| Why this structure fits | |

### Part 5c: Worst-Case Search Space

> Two bullets.

- **Worst-case number of orders considered:** _Your answer (in terms of k)._
- **Why:** _One-line justification._
